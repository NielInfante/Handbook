# A Case Study

Lets take a simple RNA seq experiment and follow the steps from start to finish.

### Set up the project folder and repo

First, I navigate to my projects folder. Now, since this will be an RNA seq project, I clone the RNA seq template from github:
```{sh}
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/NielInfante/RNAseq.git Case_study_2019_02
```

This will create the folder Case_study_2019_02, and copy everything from the template repository into it. The depth flag tells git that you only want the latest code, without all the revision history, to save a little space and time.

Now go to github and create a repository called Case_study_2019_02, and use the option to create a repo from an existing repository. Do not initialize with a README.

Then:
```{sh}
git remote add origin https://github.com/NielInfante/Case_study_2019_02.git
git push -u origin master
```

You now have your project inititalized and connected to a github repository.


### Get the data

Should I do this with Agazie data?  Project ID 22934923

I will be getting the data from BaseSpace. See \@ref(basespace). The project ID is 22934923. This is a Human RNA seq experiment, explaination here **Link to paper, if available**.



Its Human RNA, its old. Check with him, it may be published by now.

Use getFastq.R to get data

### Do QC

fastqc and multiqc

### Quantification

Get transcripts, merge them, get IDs

conda salmon
  build index
  do quantification

### Differential Expression

DESeq2


### GO, GSEA, pathway
